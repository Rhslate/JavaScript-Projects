JAVASCRIPT PROJECTS

This repository contains all of my JavaScript projects. I learned how to impliment JavaScript with HTML and CSS, and how they all
work together to create a dynamic website. 

Pizza menu:
  This is a mock menu designed to allow the user to select their favorite toppings/size for pizza, and to place an order. 
  
 Tic Tac Toe:
  This game is played by you, against the computer. The compputer randomly rolls the dice to see who goes first, then the game begins. The winner is awarded with fun sounds!

  This is a calculator created by me; it is fully functional.
